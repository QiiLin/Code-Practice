/**
In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

 

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
 

Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:

 

Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.
